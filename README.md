# SurveyKit

A simple package for creating SwiftUI Survey Views. 

Currently, three types of items are possible: 
1. Freeform text entry
2. Discrete Choice (Single Choice)
3. Continuous Choice

The package is still under development, and was created to be used in the project for my bachelor's thesis. Use at your own peril.
